# 🎉 Fun Calculator 🎉

Welcome to the **Fun Calculator** — your playful, beginner-friendly Python script that makes math feel like a party! 🥳 Whether you're adding decimals or dividing like a boss, this script will help you practice basic operations with style. 😎

---

## ✨ Features

* 📥 Accepts two **decimal** or **whole numbers**
* ➕ Performs **Addition**
* ➖ Performs **Subtraction**
* ✖️ Performs **Multiplication**
* ➗ Performs **Division**
* 🖨️ Displays results in a clear, formatted output

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **User Input**:
   Prompts the user to enter two numbers using Python’s `input()` and converts them to floats for decimal support.

2. **Calculations**:

   * Adds the numbers
   * Subtracts the second from the first
   * Multiplies the two numbers
   * Divides the first by the second (no zero-division check in this version — be careful!)

3. **Output**:
   Prints each result with a fun emoji-enhanced message.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 🔧 Requirements

* Python 3.x

### ▶️ How to Run

1. Save the script in a `.py` file, e.g., `fun_calculator.py`.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python fun_calculator.py
   ```
4. Enter two numbers when prompted, and enjoy your results!

## ⚠️ Notes

* ❗ This version **does not handle division by zero**. If you input `0` as the second number, Python will raise a `ZeroDivisionError`.
* 🧪 You can enhance the code by adding error handling using `try` and `except`.

## 🧊 Example Output

```text
Enter the first number: 12.5
Enter the second number: 2.5
Results of your two numbers:
Sum: 15.0
Difference: 10.0
Product: 31.25
Quotient: 5.0
```

## 🛠️ Future Improvements

* Add exception handling for invalid inputs and zero division
* Include more operations (modulus, exponentiation, etc.)
* Build a GUI version using Tkinter or PyQt

---

## 📚 Learning Goals

This script is great for:

* Practicing user input and output
* Understanding basic arithmetic in Python
* Working with `float` data types
* Formatting strings using `f-strings`
